![Color Scheme](assets/readme-files/color-scheme.png)

* ### Typography

  * The fonts used are ‚ÄòPT Sans' for headings and ‚ÄòNunito‚Äô for text; 'sans-serif' as a fallback font.

* ### Imagery

  * Images were chosen in regard to the topic of the website; meaning that they were chosen to be minimalistic, related to the theme and game idea.

* ### Wireframes

  * No wireframes were made for this project, however idea for this project was created in the freeform app using iPad.

## Features <h5>[Back To top](#contents)</h5>

* ### Game Container

* 'Welcome' and 'How to play' modal

<p align="center"><img src="assets/readme-files/player-nouserinput.gif"></p>

* Game board
  * Contains 12 individual tiles and 6 pairs with all of them containing animal image.
  * Player will start with 6 lives and if all tiles match, final score is 60.
  * In the game, when a player interacts with a tile, it undergoes a 180-degree flip animation. This rotation occurs along the Y-axis, creating a visually engaging effect. The flip animation allows players to reveal the hidden image on the tile and find matching pairs as part of the gameplay.

* Tile match 
  * When tiles match, score will increment by 10, sound will play and tiles will stay visible.
